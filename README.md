# Clear View Escapes. Your clarity. One trip away!

**CSS** and **JavaScript** oriented project built using *Node.js* and multiple *npm dependencies*. Introduced me to the modern workflow environment and its core concepts: *Git* & *GitHib*, *SourceTree*, *mobile-first* approach etc.


## Start

* Need **final version**? Simply check link of the app. It is *in the header* next to the *description*. 

* **Deployment code** is located in "*docs* folder. 

* To launch the **development code** on your computer download *zip file*. Extract in project empty folder. To install all dependencies open npm and type:

  ```
  npm init
  ```
  now run the code:
  
  ```
  npm run start
  ```
  You are ready to go and check travel site. ;)


## Things I've learned 

* How to **manually** set **webpack configuration**. 

  * How to build **markup elements** such as *div*, *row* etc. 
  
  * How to assign **characteristics distinctive to each element** using *class*, *id*, *section* and other selectors. 

* **Block Element Modifier** rule and other techniques for building *organized HTML*.  

* **Postcss-simple-vars**, **postcss-nested** and other plugins for building *super organized CSS*.

* How to contribute to the project via **Git** and **GitHub**: 

   * How to *create*, *commit*, *push*, *fetch* and *pull* **repos**. 
   
   * Also how **merge branches** and solve **merging conflicts**.

* How to leverage **babel** and **webpack**. Spent time to build the ruleset manually.

* **Mobile-first** approach. Moved from "top to the bottom". Developed the *mobile* web-design *first* and *desktop* design *second*.

* How to **deploy site** to the servers. *Netlify* is a great option.

* What are and how to use **cloud functions** using *Netlify* lambda functions to keep the *"secret"* code saved.

* How to test **API calls** using *Postman* app.

* How to do **responsive** and **lazy-loaded** images to optimize the perfomance and avoid loading "unnecessary" content.

 
 ## Built With

* [PostCSS Simple Vars](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-simple-vars) - allows to use variables inside CSS selectors.

* [PostCSS Nested](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested) - allows to build nested CSS blocks in hierarchical order akin to HTML and JavaScript.

* [PostCSS HexRGBA](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-hexrgba) - plugin that adds shorthand hex methods to rgba() values. 

* [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - plugin smartly adds all necessary prefixes before deployment.

* [LazySizes](https://afarkas.github.io/lazysizes/index.html) - plugin, which lazy-loads images thus optimizes the perfomance.

* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - allows to build fast fast websites. Also has its own cloud functions.
